        <p>Mexico is a country between the United States and Central America, known for its beaches
            on the
            Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, and its diverse landscape of mountains, deserts,
            and jungles.
            Ancient ruins, such as Teotihuacan and the Mayan city of Chichen Itza, are scattered
            throughout the
            country, as are cities from the Spanish colonial era. In the capital, Mexico City,
            elegant shops,
            famous museums, and gourmet restaurants are part of modern life.</p>
